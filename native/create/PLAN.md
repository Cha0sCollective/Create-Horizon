# Port plan and review checkpoints

Agreed with the project owner on 2026-11-03. The goal is a complete, unofficial
Rust implementation of Create for Horizon, delivered in reviewable increments.

## Working agreement

Each increment has a bounded feature list, automated checks, a reproducible
source commit and build, known limitations and a short visual checklist. Stop
after delivering it and wait for the owner's feedback before starting the next
increment. Automated verification is the developer's responsibility; the owner
tests appearance and interactions. Record every observation as a defect, an
unimplemented feature or a question; retain observations about later stages.

## Milestones

1. **Installation and builds (accepted).** Build through the official launcher CLI
   without local tool patches; carry code and public content in one native
   bundle; test a clean instance and GitHub source installation. Preserve normal
   Horizon instances. Deliver a launchable review instance and exact instructions.
2. **Appearance of the initial set.** Original models and textures from the
   player-supplied JAR; inventory, held, dropped and placed items; all supported
   orientations, lighting and animation. Review a visual test gallery.
3. **Behavior of the initial set.** Pin matching Create source/assets/reference
   versions. Compare Java and Rust kinetics, connection rules, direction, stress,
   pressing and depot interactions. Review a working small factory.
4. **Complete initial release.** Saves, automation, client/server synchronization,
   performance, recovery and repeated clean installation. Publish an accurately
   scoped experimental release after the review checkpoint.
5. **Expand by subsystem.** Mechanical transmissions and belts; processing;
   logistics; fluids; moving contraptions; trains. Split each subsystem into
   bounded increments with the same tests and visual review gates.
6. **Tutorials and completeness.** Ponder, remaining interfaces/effects,
   compatibility and an inventory of every original feature and known difference.

## Architecture and verification

Keep portable behavior in Rust crates and Horizon integration in a small adapter.
Preserve observable behavior and data conventions while using efficient native
Rust structures; mirroring every Java class is not a requirement. Cache compiled
recipe inputs and graph results with explicit invalidation rather than repeating
registry/recipe work for each item on every tick.
Use documented named hooks where possible; raw source mixins pin the Horizon
commit and must be revalidated on updates. Prefer internal workspace libraries;
extract reusable public libraries when their interfaces are established.

Use unit and boundary tests, Java-reference comparisons, stateful world scenarios,
save/reload checks, render checks, and actual launcher installation tests.
Test counts alone are not a completeness claim. CI records exact versions.

Plan a later shared-schematic test suite: construct the same small factory in
original Create and Horizon, supply the same inputs and actions, and compare
outputs, item components, timing, direction, failure conditions and saved state.
Use this to close gaps left by isolated method oracles and Horizon-only tests.
This cross-runtime runner is future work, not part of the current delivery and
not a promise of Java/Horizon world or schematic-format interchange.

## Distribution

The target is a GitHub URL or a reviewed Horizon registry entry followed by the
launcher's normal native build. Original Create assets are not redistributed;
the player supplies the supported JAR locally. Registry acceptance is the
maintainers' decision and does not make this an official Horizon/Create project.

## Completed increment: original interactions (0.2.0)

The owner accepted the installation checkpoint. Reported differences: shafts only
place vertically; the depot opens a chest-like menu. Implement source-derived
placement orientations and direct top-face depot exchange, preserve original
translations from the local JAR, and deliver another review build.

The owner clarified that cross-version Java/Horizon world interoperability is
not required. Preserve original Create IDs, state names and NBT conventions
where implemented. Record exceptions and avoid promising untested world compatibility.
The matching behavior/source/assets baseline is Create 6.0.10 for Minecraft 1.21.1.

Delivery: version 0.2.0, source bundle `b839dcb`, official performance build
`native-fc02103-0554886ea08b`, instance **Create Review 0.2**, new world
**CreateReview02**. Placement, direct depot exchange, all upstream locales and
the identifier baseline are implemented and checked. Stop for the owner's visual
review; this is not acceptance of the remaining appearance/behavior milestones.
See `LAUNCHER.md`, `VALIDATION.md` and `COMPATIBILITY.md` for the checklist,
evidence and explicit data-format exceptions.

## Completed increment: playable foundation (0.3.0)

The owner accepted placement, original graphics and names, and requested a larger
development interval. Reported defects: stale depot rendering after pickup,
unretrievable processing output, bulk pressing instead of the default per-item
processing, missing speed controls and incorrect/missing sound accompaniment.

1. Reproduce these failures; distinguish server inventories, client update tags,
   rendered state and player inventory. Test clicks during a processing cycle,
   partial extraction, output buffers, stack components, break/drop and reload.
2. Implement the original default pressing policy (`bulkPressing = false`),
   a proper depot processing/output model and explicit client snapshot clearing.
3. Extend the kinetic core with perpendicular large gears, gearboxes, clutches,
   gearshifts and a hand crank. Add persistent motor speed/direction control,
   wrench interactions and redstone switching. Compare source-derived rules.
4. Add the material/casing/crafting foundation for the implemented machines,
   retaining upstream IDs and recipe identities. Import required original models,
   textures and sounds only from the player's JAR.
5. Check unit/state-machine tests, Java oracles, actual crafting, hopper/player
   exchanges, client snapshots/rendering, power changes and saves through Horizon's
   control API. Inspect the matching Prism Create installation as a reference;
   never alter its existing worlds.
6. Deliver another native performance build with a new review world and an exact
   feature/limitation list, then stop for visual review. Unimplemented mechanisms
   are not counted as features merely because an item can be spawned.


0.3 automated checkpoint: implemented the 17-block/26-entry foundation, 30 source
recipes, default per-item pressing, cleared client snapshots, motor controls,
transmissions, wrench/casings and item/hopper/world IO. The performance Metal
scenario passed without skipped checks; 34 Rust tests and four Java oracles pass.
The Prism reference JAR/config were inspected read-only; Java gameplay itself was
not run. The delivered native package corresponds to source `12d83a0`.

Review instance: **Create Foundation 0.3**, world **CreateFoundation03**, official
performance build `native-fc02103-7ea49a8f5494`. Remain at this checkpoint for the
owner's visual/audio feedback before expanding to belts and further processing.


## Previous increment: engineer tools, feedback and survival power (0.4.0)

The owner visually accepted depot IO/default pressing, mechanical propagation,
wrench rotation and speed limits in 0.3, then requested a wider next increment.
Observed defects: opposing visible angular motion across adjacent split-shaft
ports, hand-crank handle facing/animation and non-rotating base, incomplete depot
item presentation. Missing scope: vertical gearbox item, brass pressing, goggles,
speed/stress instruments, placement assistance, particles and survival generators.

1. Compare rendering transforms and crank interpolation to pinned Java, including
   all axis signs. Verify actual rendered poses, not only server RPM fields.
2. Add original vertical gearbox item/conversions, brass sheet/pressing, engineer
   goggles and speed/stress gauges with their recipes, states and saved readings.
3. Add a reusable translated information HUD and in-world connection/rotation
   feedback, plus source-derived processing/kinetic particles through Horizon.
4. Add small/large water wheels with flow generation, capacity, placement and
   physical occupancy rules derived from Java. Keep moving contraptions as their
   own later subsystem; do not simulate them with decorative placeholder items.
5. Extend source oracles and real-game interaction/render/save tests. Preserve the
   owner's finished 0.3 world; prepare a separate native review instance/world.
6. Publish a tested build and stop again for visual/audio review. Scope and timing
   are governed by a coherent working increment, not a percentage-of-mod claim.

## Current increment: milling, bulk fan processing and stationary drilling (0.5.0)

Extend the usable processing chain with the source millstone and encased fan,
including washing, smoking, haunting and blasting, plus stationary drill block
breaking. Keep the existing engineering
and foundation scenarios as regression coverage. The public catalog now contains
24 blocks, 15 standalone items, 123 source recipes and 35 tags; the local JAR
importer prepares 324 private resource files with cache schema 7.

1. Port millstone kinetics, timer, probabilistic output, filtered inventory,
   fallen-item intake and output-first empty-hand collection. Preserve original
   inventory names and timer on save/reload, and render the original inner part.
2. Port the fan's six-way shaft/placement behavior, push/pull range, obstruction
   and media segments, item acceleration, stack timing and depot processing.
   Use actual Minecraft cooking recipes for smoking/blasting and source
   Create recipes for washing/haunting.
3. Add the genuine propeller, wheat-flour and dough ingredients, source crafting
   recipes and supported vanilla processing results. Keep original assets private
   and import only JSON or Horizon-supported OBJ resources from the supplied JAR.
4. Compare millstone/fan algorithms with pinned Java method bodies; check real
   item IO, tagged ingredients, blocked outputs, power changes, all orientations,
   saves and client presentation in native Horizon. Complete the full regression
   and launcher build before describing a tested 0.5 delivery.
5. Add the stationary mechanical drill with source facing/waterlogged states,
   front-block break progress, rear shaft, ordinary loot and rotating head. Keep
   contraption drilling, entity damage and automatic block placement out of scope.
6. Prepare a separate review world and record its exact source/build/instance in
   `VALIDATION.md`. Preserve the owner's previous worlds. The visual checklist is
   in `LAUNCHER.md`; the native verification is still being completed.

Explicit current omissions: fan airflow on mobs/players, full audiovisual parity,
belts and nozzle behavior. Dropped-item processing progress is now represented in
the canonical `NeoForgeData.CreateData.Processing.Type/Time` entity fields using
Horizon's existing persistent unknown-field storage; native save/reload validation
has passed, including exact remaining time and unknown sibling fields.
Depot-held progress uses its saved transported-item fields. Neither
path stores entity state in item components or requires another raw hook.
